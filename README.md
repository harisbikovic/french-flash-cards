# French Flash Cards
This game can be used by someone learning french words. The concept of the game is that a card containing a word in french is shown to the user, then after 3 seconds
the card is flipped and english translation is shown. If the user already knows the word he should click the right(green) button indicating that he knows the word,
otherwise he should click the red button which means he's still to learn that word. When the user clicks the right button that word is deleted from the list of the words
so that it would never appear again. This way the user can only focus on the words that are he is unfamiliar with.
